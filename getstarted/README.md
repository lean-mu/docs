# Introduction

Mu is a serverless functions platform which can be deployed anywhere.

For those willing to explore quickly,  it is best to leverage one of Mu's internal component: Project Fn. Fn provides a lightweight command line tool that can run a single instance on your laptop. It is perfect to get a first feeling or presentations/demos.  

For more serious deployments, consider installing the Mu Platform on a Kubernetes cluster. Detailing the benefits of such installation is obviously beyond this quickstart.

Please pick the option that best fits your aspirations.
